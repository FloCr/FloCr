Having started my professional career 10 years ago, I developed project and product management skills, in a CAC 40 company. Recently graduated from Le Wagon, I’m now able to give a hand to developers, better understand their daily activities, and challenge them. Today, I’m looking for new opportunity as Product Owner or Product Manager.

Please find below 2 web applications i developped with 3 team mates in Le Wagon :
- Waste market: 8 days project, to buy and sell second hand perishable products with key features (barcode scan, QR code to secure transaction, ...) - http://www.wastemarket.lol
- AIR-TA: 4 days project, to book a teacher assistant - https://air-ta.herokuapp.com/
