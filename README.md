Having started my professional career 10 years ago, I developed project and product management skills, in a CAC 40 company. Recently graduated from Le Wagon, Iâ€™m now able to give a hand to developers, better understand their daily activities, and challenge them. Today, Iâ€™m looking for new opportunity as Product Owner or Product Manager.

Please find below 2 web applications i developped with 3 team mates in Le Wagon :
