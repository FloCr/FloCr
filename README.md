ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Florian CarriÃ¨re

In a decade-long career beginning in international banking, I've sharpened my project and product management skills.
My recent graduation from Le Wagon as a Full Stack Developer led me to create NarvalSport.com, enhancing water sports accessibility.
Eager to merge my technical skills with strategic insight, Iâ€™m now focused on pursuing my passion in product management.
